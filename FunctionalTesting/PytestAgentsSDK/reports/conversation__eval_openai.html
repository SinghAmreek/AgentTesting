I will now proceed to find the best options for you.;Bot says: **Product Recommendation for Acid Handling Gloves**\\n\\n**Key Considerations:**\\n- **Chemical Protection:** For handling acids, gloves should comply with EN ISO 374 standards, which specify protection against chemicals and/or micro-organisms. The catalogue lists several acids (e.g., Nitric Acid 65%, Acetic Acid 99%, Sulphuric Acid 96%, Hydrofluoric Acid 40%) and indicates that gloves are tested for resistance to these chemicals under EN ISO 374-1:2016 Type B, which requires at least Level 2 performance (over 30 minutes) against at least three chemicals from the list. This ensures suitability for acid handling tasks [1]\\u200b[2].\\n- **Low Cut Resistance:** Gloves with a low cut level rating are recommended for general handling, shipping, receiving, warehouse work, and similar tasks where high cut protection is not required. This aligns with your need for low cut resistance [1].\\n- **High Dexterity &amp; Minimized Hand Fatigue:** Gloves that are lightweight, soft, and flexible provide maximum dexterity and reduce hand fatigue. Proper fit is crucial\\u2014tight gloves can restrict dexterity and cause discomfort, while loose gloves can affect grip. The size guide helps ensure the correct fit, ranging from 2XS to 3XL, based on hand circumference [1].\\n- **Length (Up to Elbows):** While the catalogue references cuff testing for gloves longer than 40 cm under EN 374-1, it does not specify particular models with elbow-length coverage. However, gloves meeting this standard are likely to be available in longer lengths for enhanced forearm protection [2].\\n\\n**Compliance:**\\n- **EN ISO 374-1:2016 Type B** for chemical protection (including acids).\\n- **EN 374-5** for micro-organism resistance.\\n\\n**Sizes Available:**\\n- 2XS (127 mm) to 3XL (304 mm) hand circumference, ensuring a proper fit for dexterity and comfort [1].\\n\\n**Summary Table:**\\n\\n| Feature                | Details                                                                 |\\n|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|\\n| Chemical Protection    | EN ISO 374-1:2016 Type B (Acids)                                        |\\n| Cut Resistance         | Low (suitable for general handling)                                     |\\n| Dexterity &amp; Comfort    | Lightweight, soft, flexible, proper fit minimizes hand fatigue          |\\n| Length                 | Elbow-length options implied by cuff testing for &gt;40cm gloves           |\\n| Sizes                  | 2XS to 3XL (127 mm to 304 mm hand circumference)                        |\\n| Compliance             | EN ISO 374-1:2016, EN 374-5                                             |\\n\\nThese features ensure the gloves are suitable for handling acids, provide high dexterity, minimize hand fatigue, and offer low cut resistance, with options for extended length to protect up to the elbows [1]\\u200b[2].\\n\\n[1]: cite:1 \&#34;Citation-1\&#34;\\n[2]: cite:2 \&#34;Citation-2\&#34;;Bot says: Please provide the feedback about the prompt and the search results including the output structure, completeness and quality etc.]&#34;: [{&#34;extras&#34;: [], &#34;result&#34;: &#34;Passed&#34;, &#34;duration&#34;: &#34;00:00:05&#34;, &#34;resultsTableRow&#34;: [&#34;&lt;td class=\&#34;col-result\&#34;&gt;Passed&lt;/td&gt;&#34;, &#34;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&#34;, &#34;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&#34;, &#34;&lt;td title=\&#34;Bot says: Hello, I&amp;apos;m Product Advisor, a virtual assistant.

These are designed for single-use and are individually packed for hygiene and convenience.\n- **Construction Work Suitability:** The masks listed are ideal for use in environments with dust and particulates generated from construction activities like sanding, grinding, and sawing.\n- **Compliance:** The masks comply with AS/NZS 1716:2012 standards for respiratory protection, and some hygiene face masks comply with GB/T 32610-2016 for daily protective masks.\n- **Comfort Features:** Many options include adjustable nosepieces, soft rubber nose seals, twin rubber headbands, and latex-free ear loops for comfort and secure fit.\n\n### Relevant Products:\n- **P2 Trifold Non-Valved Respirator:** Offers protection against mechanically and thermally generated particles, suitable for construction dust, and is disposable. Complies with AS/NZS 1716:2012. Part Number: 0165 7232.\n- **P1 and P2 Respirators (Flat Fold, Cupped, With/Without Valve):** Designed for dust protection in construction, available in various designs for comfort and fit, and are disposable.\n- **Disposable Hygiene Face Mask:** General purpose, 3-ply non-woven, disposable, but not specified for N99 or construction dust.\n\n### Compliance and Sizes:\n- All listed respirators comply with AS/NZS 1716:2012.\n- Disposable hygiene face masks comply with GB/T 32610-2016.\n- Standard pack sizes and part numbers are provided for easy selection.\n\n**Note:** None of the listed products specifically mention N99 filtration efficiency. The highest available is P2, which is roughly equivalent to N95 but not N99. For N99-level protection, you may need to look for a product explicitly labeled as N99, which is not present in the current catalogue information [1]\u200b[2]\u200b[3].\n\n[1]: cite:1 &amp;quot;Citation-1&amp;quot;\n[2]: cite:2 &amp;quot;Citation-2&amp;quot;\n[3]: cite:3 &amp;quot;Citation-3&amp;quot;;Bot says: Please provide the feedback about the prompt and the search results including the output structure, completeness and quality etc.&lt;/td&gt;&#34;, &#34;&lt;td&gt;0.73&lt;/td&gt;&#34;, &#34;&lt;td title=\&#34;The bot asked relevant questions to clarify user needs for both gloves and facemasks, and provided product recommendations aligned with the user&amp;apos;s requirements.

Gloves designed for chemical resistance should be prioritized for this scenario [1]\\u200b[2].\\n- **Grip and Dexterity:** Consider the environment (wet, oily, or dry) and the need for fine dexterity versus durability. For chemical handling, grip in wet conditions and chemical-resistant coatings are important [2].\\n- **Comfort and Compliance:** Ensure gloves are comfortable and available in a full-size range to fit all workers, as discomfort can lead to non-compliance in wearing protective equipment [1]\\u200b[2].\\n- **Compliance and Certification:** Verify that gloves meet relevant standards such as EN 388 / AS/NZS 2161.3 for chemical resistance. Specific ratings for chemical protection should be checked, especially for acid handling [1]\\u200b[3].\\n\\n**Recommended Features:**\\n- Chemical-resistant material (such as nitrile, neoprene, or PVC)\\n- Certified to relevant standards for chemical protection\\n- Good grip in wet conditions\\n- Available in multiple sizes for workforce diversity\\n- Comfortable fit to encourage consistent use\\n\\n**Product Examples:**\\nWhile the retrieved documents focus on cut-resistant gloves, they highlight the importance of selecting gloves based on secondary hazards like chemical exposure.

The selection framework recommends asking if gloves will come into contact with oils, chemicals, or liquids, which applies directly to acid handling. Gloves designed for chemical resistance should be prioritized for this scenario [1]\u200b[2].\n- **Grip and Dexterity:** Consider the environment (wet, oily, or dry) and the need for fine dexterity versus durability. For chemical handling, grip in wet conditions and chemical-resistant coatings are important [2].\n- **Comfort and Compliance:** Ensure gloves are comfortable and available in a full-size range to fit all workers, as discomfort can lead to non-compliance in wearing protective equipment [1]\u200b[2].\n- **Compliance and Certification:** Verify that gloves meet relevant standards such as EN 388 / AS/NZS 2161.3 for chemical resistance. Specific ratings for chemical protection should be checked, especially for acid handling [1]\u200b[3].\n\n**Recommended Features:**\n- Chemical-resistant material (such as nitrile, neoprene, or PVC)\n- Certified to relevant standards for chemical protection\n- Good grip in wet conditions\n- Available in multiple sizes for workforce diversity\n- Comfortable fit to encourage consistent use\n\n**Product Examples:**\nWhile the retrieved documents focus on cut-resistant gloves, they highlight the importance of selecting gloves based on secondary hazards like chemical exposure.

While not directly rated in the standards, gloves with higher flexibility and lower bulk are preferable. Chemical gloves of Type B or C may offer better dexterity than Type A, but with reduced chemical protection [1].\\n\\n- **Fatigue Protection:**\\n  While not a specific standard, gloves designed to reduce hand fatigue often feature ergonomic designs, lightweight materials, and good fit.
