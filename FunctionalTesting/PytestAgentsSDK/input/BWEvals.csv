**Example of Performance Level Ratings (EN388:2003 4144 abcd) for Gloves Used in Mining**

- **EN388:2003 4144 abcd** is a performance rating system for protective gloves, indicating their resistance to various mechanical hazards:
  - **Abrasion Resistance (a):** Level 4 (8000 cycles)
  - **Blade Cut Resistance (b):** Level 1 (1.2 index)
  - **Tear Resistance (c):** Level 4 (75 Newtons)
  - **Puncture Resistance (d):** Level 4 (150 Newtons)

- For example, the WeldTEC Black & Gold glove has the following EN388:2003 rating: **4144** for abrasion, blade cut, tear, and puncture resistance, making it suitable for demanding environments such as mining, welding, and metal fabrication [1].

- Gloves like the Durashield Cut D are also suitable for mining and comply with EN388:2016+A1:2018, which is an updated standard for mechanical risks [2].

**Example of Performance Level Ratings (EN388:2003 4144 abcd) for Gloves in Mining or Similar Industries**

- The EN388:2003 standard rates gloves for mechanical risks using four numbers (abcd), each representing a specific type of resistance:
  - **a**: Abrasion Resistance (1-4)
  - **b**: Blade Cut Resistance (1-5)
  - **c**: Tear Resistance (1-4)
  - **d**: Puncture Resistance (1-4)

- A rating of **4144** means:
  - **4**: Highest level of abrasion resistance (8000 cycles)
  - **1**: Lowest level of blade cut resistance (index 1.2)
  - **4**: Highest level of tear resistance (75 Newtons)
  - **4**: Highest level of puncture resistance (150 Newtons)

- This rating is suitable for gloves used in demanding environments such as mining, metal fabrication, and construction, where high abrasion, tear, and puncture resistance are critical, but blade cut resistance is minimal. For example, the WeldTECH Black Glove is rated EN388:2003 4144, making it appropriate for such industries [1]​[2].
