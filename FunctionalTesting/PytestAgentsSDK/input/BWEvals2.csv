2. No;User says: y;Bot says: Thank you for providing the details. Based on your requirements, you need gloves for handling acids, up to the elbows, with low cut resistance, high dexterity, and that minimize hand fatigue. I will now proceed to find the best options for you.;Bot says: **Product Recommendation for Acid Handling Gloves**

**Key Considerations:**
- **Chemical Protection:** For handling acids, gloves should comply with EN ISO 374 standards, which specify protection against chemicals and/or micro-organisms. The catalogue lists several acids (e.g., Nitric Acid 65%, Acetic Acid 99%, Sulphuric Acid 96%, Hydrofluoric Acid 40%) and indicates that gloves are tested for resistance to these chemicals under EN ISO 374-1:2016 Type B, which requires at least Level 2 performance (over 30 minutes) against at least three chemicals from the list. This ensures suitability for acid handling tasks [1]​[2].
- **Low Cut Resistance:** Gloves with a low cut level rating are recommended for general handling, shipping, receiving, warehouse work, and similar tasks where high cut protection is not required. This aligns with your need for low cut resistance [1].
- **High Dexterity & Minimized Hand Fatigue:** Gloves that are lightweight, soft, and flexible provide maximum dexterity and reduce hand fatigue. Proper fit is crucial—tight gloves can restrict dexterity and cause discomfort, while loose gloves can affect grip. The size guide helps ensure the correct fit, ranging from 2XS to 3XL, based on hand circumference [1].
- **Length (Up to Elbows):** While the catalogue references cuff testing for gloves longer than 40 cm under EN 374-1, it does not specify particular models with elbow-length coverage. However, gloves meeting this standard are likely to be available in longer lengths for enhanced forearm protection [2].

**Compliance:**
- **EN ISO 374-1:2016 Type B** for chemical protection (including acids).
- **EN 374-5** for micro-organism resistance.

**Sizes Available:**
- 2XS (127 mm) to 3XL (304 mm) hand circumference, ensuring a proper fit for dexterity and comfort [1].

**Summary Table:**

---

**Key Considerations:**

- **Cut Resistance Level 5:**
  According to EN 388, Level 5 cut resistance is the highest performance class for the coupe test, indicating an index value of ≥ 20. This level is suitable for high-risk tasks such as masonry work where sharp tools and materials are handled frequently [1].

- **Impact Protection:**
  Gloves with impact protection are marked with the letter ""P"" as the sixth character in the EN 388 rating. If the glove does not have a ""P,"" it does not claim impact protection. For masonry work, impact protection is important to guard against knocks and blows [1]​[2].

- **High Dexterity and Flexibility:**
  The EN 388 standard does not directly rate dexterity or flexibility, but gloves with high cut resistance made from advanced materials (such as high-performance fibers) are designed to offer both protection and flexibility. Look for gloves that specifically mention these features in their product description [1].

- **Size Large:**
  Ensure the glove is available in size Large for a comfortable fit and optimal performance.

---

**Compliance and Features:**

- **EN 388:2016 Standard:**
  - Level 5 cut resistance (index ≥ 20) for maximum protection against cuts.
  - Impact protection indicated by the letter ""P"" in the rating.
  - Additional TDM test (ISO 13997) may be used for materials that dull blades, with the highest performance level ""F"" (≥ 30 Newtons) [1]​[2].

- **Glove Markings:**
  - Look for the EN 388 pictogram followed by four numbers (performance levels) and two letters. The higher the number, the better the protection.
  - The fifth position letter (A-F) indicates the TDM cut resistance score, with ""F"" being the highest.
  - The sixth position ""P"" confirms impact protection [2].

---

**Summary Table:**

| Feature                | Requirement/Standard         | What to Look For                |
|------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Cut Resistance         | EN 388 Level 5 (≥ 20 index) | Marked as ""5"" in cut resistance  |

**Key Considerations:**
- **Chemical Protection:**
  Gloves must comply with EN ISO 374-1:2016 for chemical safety, specifically for acids. Type A gloves offer the highest permeation resistance (at least 30 minutes with 6 test chemicals), Type B (30 minutes with 3 chemicals), and Type C (10 minutes with 1 chemical). For handling acids, Type A or B is recommended for better protection. The glove should display the Erlenmeyer flask pictogram with letters indicating tested chemicals [1].

- **Cut Resistance:**
  Medium cut resistance is typically classified as performance class C or D under EN 388:2016/ISO 13997, which corresponds to a Newton value of ≥10 (C) or ≥15 (D). The rating scale from A to F is used, with C and D being suitable for medium cut protection [1].

- **Dexterity:**
  High dexterity is generally achieved with gloves that are not overly thick and allow for precise movements. While not directly rated in the standards, gloves with higher flexibility and lower bulk are preferable. Chemical gloves of Type B or C may offer better dexterity than Type A, but with reduced chemical protection [1].

- **Fatigue Protection:**
  While not a specific standard, gloves designed to reduce hand fatigue often feature ergonomic designs, lightweight materials, and good fit. This is not directly addressed in the standards but should be considered when selecting gloves for prolonged use [1].

**Compliance and Features:**
- **EN ISO 374-1:2016:** Ensures chemical resistance, especially for acids.
- **EN 388:2016/ISO 13997:** Confirms medium cut resistance (C or D rating).
